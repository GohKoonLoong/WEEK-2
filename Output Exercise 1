I wake up at 8 in the morning for morning class
I will take a shower and brush my teeth 
Before attending class,I will take my breakfast
I will browse through the assignments and notes given by lecturer after class
Later on,I will take my lunch and prepare for afternoon and evening class
After all the classes have end,I will spend some time chatting with my family
